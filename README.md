# monkemod is a dying community
today, (july 19th 2024), i was banned from the gorilla tag modding group for simply being in the same room/area as 64will64.

the moderators of monkemod believe i was involved with 64will64 being a tester of an unreleased mod. the last thing i had done with the mod's development was **before** will was ever a tester, and before the recent orgscoping exploit either existed or was being used.

the moderation in both monkemod and gorilla tag itself is horrible and vastly flawed and needs major refactoring to be fair in any capacity.

i'm done. completely done. i am unlikely to EVER work on a mod for monkemod again, if i keep doing gorilla tag mods they will EXCLUSIVELY be hosted in mine and/or friends servers. i am not wasting my time for it to be thrown away by the greedy people who now rule this game.

i may look into making mods for a different game, one that cares about its community and will listen. maybe resonite or something, i don't know.

my ban had been reduced to 1 week, devs being 2 weeks, however what i said still stands. go to either [dev's server](https://discord.gg/dev9998) or [my server](https://discord.gg/QSuRSQVMSP) for updates
