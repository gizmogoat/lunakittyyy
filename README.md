# projects update
All of my Gorilla Tag projects are in maintenance mode.

Every one of my Gorilla Tag mods will be getting **no** new features and I will not be releasing any new Gorilla Tag mods until further notice.
Some of my existing mods may get bug-fixes, depending on the severity of the bug, but all mods until further notice are under **NO SUPPORT**. 

If you are a developer, you are welcome to contribute patches and pull requests to my mods and I will review and merge them.

I haven't been interested in developing for Gorilla Tag for a few months now and I do not wish to make anything for the time being.

WEBFISHING mods are unaffected & not related
