# projects update
Every one of my Gorilla Tag projects will only be updated on a basis where I personally need them, and I will not be releasing any new Gorilla Tag mod binaries until further notice (source code for anything I make may still be offered)
All mods until further notice are under **NO SUPPORT** and **I AM NOT OBLIGATED TO HELP YOU** with their usage. 

If you are a developer, you are welcome to contribute patches and pull requests to my mods and I will review and merge them.

I haven't been interested in developing for Gorilla Tag for a few months now and I do not wish to make anything for the time being.

Mods for other games are unaffected & not related
